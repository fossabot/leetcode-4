 * Testcase Example:  '[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n0'
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 *
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
 * index, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 *
 * Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: -1
 *
