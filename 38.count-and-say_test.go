 *
 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five
 * terms as following:
 *
 *
 * 1.     1
 * 2.     11
 * 3.     21
 * 4.     1211
 * 5.     111221
 *
 *
 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
 *
 * Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the n^th term of the
 * count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the
 * previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups
 * of the same digit.
 *
 * Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a
 * string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: 1
 * Output: "1"
 * Explanation: This is the base case.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: 4
 * Output: "1211"
 * Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and
 * "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the
 * same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and
 * "11" which is "1211".
